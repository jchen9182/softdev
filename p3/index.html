        <h1> SHELL SCRIPTING </h1>

        <h2> What is the Kernel? </h2>
            The kernel is a computer program that controls everything in the system.
            <br>
            It handles interactions between the hardware and software and is basically
            the core of the OS.
            <br>
            For example, it might manage files, memory, or I/O.
        <br>

        <h2> What is the Shell? </h2>
            The shell is a program that lets the user interact with the kernel.
            <br>
            It's accessed from the command line or terminal.
            <br>
            Some examples are bash, zsh, and csh.
        <br>

        <h2> BASH Shell Scripts </h2>
            A shell script is a file that contains commands that the shell runs.
            <br>
            They allow you to automate things and add your own commands to the shell.
            <h3> Pros </h3>
                It's easy to write short scripts.
                <br>
                The commands you type are the same as the ones used in bash.
                <br>
                Piping is very simple to do. You can read more about piping
                <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piping-in-unix-or-linux/"> 
                here</a>.
            <h3> Cons </h3>
                Execution time is slow.
                <br>
                Shell scripts aren't well-suited for long and complex tasks.
        <br>

        <h2> Notes </h2>
            Make sure your script is executable by doing chmod +x [path to script].
            <br>
            <br>
            Your script can be saved with .sh or no extension at all.
            <br>
            <br>
            Your script must always have #!/bin/bash at the beginning of the file.
            <br>
            It lets the system know that this is a bash script.
            <br>
            <br>
            To execute your script, there are many ways such as ./[script] or 
            bash [script].
        <br>

        <h2> What can we do? </h2>
            <h3> Using Variables </h3>
                <img src = "pics/a.png">
                <br>
                <img src = "pics/ares.png">
                <br>
                A variable can be any type.
            <h3> Reading User Input </h3>
                <img src = "pics/b.png">
                <br>
                <img src = "pics/bres.png">
                <br>
                read takes in a variable to store the user input.
            <h3> Arrays </h3>
                <img src = "pics/c.png">
                <br>
                <img src = "pics/cres.png">
                <br>
                Arrays don't need to be declared. You can just set an index equal to a value.
                <br>
                You can also use parentheses with spaces to declare an entire array.
                <br>
                Use the syntax above to access an array. * and @ access the entire array.
            <h3> Operators include link </h3>
                There are a bit too many operators so please refer
                <a href = "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-basic-operators.htm">
                here</a>.
            <h3> If...else </h3>
                <img src = "pics/d.png">
                <br>
                <img src = "pics/dres.png">
            <h3> Loops </h3>
                <img src = "pics/e.png">
                <br>
                <img src = "pics/eres.png">
                <img src = "pics/eres2.png">
                <br>
                The first loop runs while i is less than three. It prints i and adds one to it.
                <br>
                The second loop is basically a for-each loop.
            <h3> Functions </h3>
                <img src = "pics/f.png">
                <br>
                <img src = "pics/fres.png">
        <br>
